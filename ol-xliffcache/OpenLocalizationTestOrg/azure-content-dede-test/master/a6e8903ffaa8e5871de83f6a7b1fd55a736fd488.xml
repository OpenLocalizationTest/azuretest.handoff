Azure Government offers physical and network isolation from non-U.S. government deployments and provides screened U.S. personnel. \n\nMicrosoft provides a number of tools to create and deploy cloud applications to Microsoft’s global Microsoft Azure service (“Global Service”) and Microsoft Azure Government services.\n\nWhen creating and deploying applications to the Azure Government Services, as opposed to the Global Service, developers need to know the key differences of the two services.  Specifically around setting up and configuring their programming environment, configuring endpoints, writing applications, and deploying them as services to Azure Government.\n\nThe information in this document summarizes those differences and supplements the information available on the [Azure Government](http://www.azure.com/gov \"Azure Government\") site and the [Microsoft Azure Technical Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/cloud-app-development-msdn \"MSDN\") on MSDN.
