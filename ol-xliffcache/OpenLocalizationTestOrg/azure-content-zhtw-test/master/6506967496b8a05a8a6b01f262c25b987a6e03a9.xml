It is Enterprise Admin, and not Domain Admin, to make sure the permissions in Active Directory can be set in all domains.\n\n### Global Admin credentials\nThese credentials are only used during the installation and will not be used after the installation has completed. It is used to create the [Azure AD account](#azure-ad-service-account) used for synchronizing changes to Azure AD. The account will also enable sync as a feature in Azure AD.

The installation wizard will not verify the permissions and any issues will only be found during synchronization.\n\nWhich permissions you require depends on the optional features you enable. If you have multiple domains, the permissions must be granted for all domains in the forest.

The created account will be located in the forest root domain in the Users container and will have its name prefixed with **MSOL_**. The account is created with a long complex password which does not expire. If you have a password policy in your domain, make sure long and complex passwords would be allowed for this account.\n\n![AD account](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-accounts-permissions/adsyncserviceaccount.png)\n\n### Azure AD Connect sync service accounts\nTwo local service accounts are created by the installation wizard (unless you specify the account to use in custom settings). The account prefixed **AAD_** is used for the actual sync service to run as. If you install Azure AD Connect on a Domain Controller, the accounts are created in the domain. If you use a SQL server on a remote server, the **AAD_** service account must be located in the domain. The account prefixed **AADSyncSched_** is used for the scheduled task which is running the sync engine.\n\n![Sync Service Account](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-accounts-permissions/syncserviceaccount.png)\n\nThe accounts are created with a long complex password which does not expire.\n\nFor the sync engine service account, this account will be used by Windows to store the encryption keys so the password for this account should not be reset or changed.\n\nIf you use a full SQL Server then the service account will be the DBO of the created database for the sync engine. The service will not function as intended with any other permissions. A SQL login will also be created.\n\nThe account is also granted permissions to files, registry keys, and other objects related to the Sync Engine.\n\n### Azure AD service account\nAn account in Azure AD will be created for the sync service's use. This account can be identified with its display name.\n\n![AD account](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-accounts-permissions/aadsyncserviceaccount.png)\n\nThe name of the server the account is used on can be identified in the second part of the user name. In the picture above the server name is FABRIKAMCON. If you have staging servers, each server will have its own account. There is a limit of 10 sync service accounts in Azure AD.\n\nThe service account is created with a long complex password which does not expire. It is granted a special role **Directory Synchronization Accounts** which has only permissions to perform directory synchronization tasks.
